# WORKER AGENT (3-phase harness)

You are the WORKER in a Planner→Worker→Judge pipeline.
Your job: execute `.agent/plan.md` as written, with minimal scope creep.

Non-interactive run (`codex exec`): do not ask questions. If unclear, make the smallest reasonable assumption and log it.

## Stop conditions
- If `.agent/STOP` exists: append “STOP seen” to `.agent/progress.md` and exit.
- If `.agent/DONE` exists: append “DONE seen” to `.agent/progress.md` and exit.

## Inputs you MUST read
- `.agent/PROJECT.md` (authoritative; includes TEST_CMD/LINT_CMD)
- `AGENTS.md` (repo rules)
- `docs/spec.md`
- `docs/dev.md` (if exists)
- `.agent/plan.md`
- `.agent/judge_feedback.md` (if present)
- `.agent/queue.md`
- `.agent/progress.md`
- `.agent/state.md`

## Core rules
- Implement ONLY the single task in `.agent/plan.md`.
- Do NOT mark tasks done in `.agent/queue.md` (Judge owns that).
- Prefer small, coherent changes. No big refactors unless the task explicitly requires it.
- All network-dependent logic must be best-effort with timeouts and exception handling.
- Bind server to localhost only.
- Queue must be strictly sequential: one job at a time; no parallel transcription runs.
- Never print secrets. If you need to log config, mask tokens.

## Logging
Ensure `.agent/logs/` exists.
Write/overwrite `.agent/worker_report.md` with:
- task id/title
- what changed (bullets)
- files changed (list)
- commands run + result (pass/fail)
- if failure: include a short excerpt of the error and what you think is next

Also append a WORKER entry to `.agent/progress.md` with:
- timestamp
- CODEX_ITERATION
- task id
- test + lint status summary

## Verification (must do)
Run TEST_CMD (from PROJECT.md). Capture output into a file.

Tip: to preserve exit codes with tee:
- use: `bash -lc "set -o pipefail; <TEST_CMD> 2>&1 | tee .agent/logs/test_${CODEX_ITERATION}.log"`

If LINT_CMD is set and command exists, run similarly and capture output:
- `.agent/logs/lint_${CODEX_ITERATION}.log`

If tests fail and you cannot fix quickly:
- write/update `.agent/BLOCKED.md` with exact errors + next steps
- exit (do not thrash)

## Output
Print a short summary:
- what you implemented
- test status
- pointers to worker_report + log files

mcp startup: no servers

# PROJECT (single source of truth for the harness)

PROJECT_NAME: "whisper-webui-mlx"
REPO_KIND: "new repo"

## Brief (1–2 paragraphs)
Build a **local macOS app for Apple Silicon (M1+)** that exposes a **Web UI on localhost** to manage **offline transcription** of audio/video files using the engine from `whisper-turbo-mlx` via its CLI `wtm` (MLX). https://github.com/JosefAlbers/whisper-turbo-mlx

Turn the current console workflow (e.g. `wtm ... --any_lang=True`) into a tool that is easy to deploy on another M1+ Mac with **one command**, supports **batch uploads**, a **strictly sequential** processing queue (no parallelism), **job history + downloads**, optional **Telegram delivery of TXT results**, and (in the final phase) **live recording + chunked transcription**.

## Primary stack
Python 3.11+
- Backend/Web: FastAPI + Uvicorn
- Templates/UI: Jinja2 + minimal vanilla JS (no external CDNs; must work offline)
- Storage: SQLite (jobs metadata) + local filesystem (uploads/results/logs)
- Worker: a single sequential worker consuming a persistent queue
- Transcription: subprocess call to `wtm` with explicit language selection

## Commands (choose defaults if unknown)
TEST_CMD: "make test"
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cat AGENTS.md' in /Users/ivankhokhlov/code/mlx-ui succeeded in 91ms:
# AGENTS.md

This repo is developed using an autonomous loop (Planner → Worker → Judge) driven by `codex exec`.
Because each run starts with limited context, **durable state MUST be stored in `.agent/`**.

## Source of truth
- `.agent/PROJECT.md` — high-level constraints and commands
- `docs/spec.md` — product requirements
- `.agent/queue.md` — backlog (Judge marks tasks done)

## How to run
- Tests: `make test`
- Lint: `make lint`
- Format: `make fmt`
- Run server: `make run`

If Makefile does not exist yet, create it during bootstrap.

## Safety / security rules
- Never touch anything outside the repo root.

**Reviewing key documentation and state files**
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cat docs/spec.md' in /Users/ivankhokhlov/code/mlx-ui succeeded in 93ms:
# Spec — whisper-webui-mlx

## Goal
Create a **local-only** tool for **macOS Apple Silicon (M1+)** that provides a **Web UI on localhost** to manage **local transcription** of audio/video files using the engine from `whisper-turbo-mlx` via its CLI `wtm` (MLX).

The tool must be easy to deploy to another M1+ Mac (one command), and after the initial setup + model download it must work **fully offline**.

## MVP: Batch file transcription via Web UI
### UX
- User opens Web UI (localhost).
- User uploads **one or multiple files** (audio or video).
- User selects the **language manually** (no auto-detect).
- Files are placed into a **queue** and processed **strictly sequentially** (no parallel jobs).
- UI has:
  - Queue view: current job + pending jobs
  - History view: completed jobs + access to results

### Processing rules
- One worker processes one job at a time (sequential).
- Keep the ML model “warm” behavior in mind: avoid parallelism and avoid reinitialization churn.

exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'test -f docs/dev.md && cat docs/dev.md' in /Users/ivankhokhlov/code/mlx-ui succeeded in 115ms:
# Developer guide

## Requirements (target)
- macOS Apple Silicon (M1+)
- Python 3.11+
- Homebrew (for system deps like ffmpeg)

## Quick start (eventual)
```bash
./scripts/setup_and_run.sh
```

## Manual dev loop
```bash
poetry install --with dev

make test
make run
```

**Identifying key files for state and feedback**

I'm focusing on the plan, judge_feedback, queue, progress, and state files for review to understand their roles, using cat to inspect their contents.

# Plan

Task: WUI-002 — Minimal WebUI shell
Acceptance: localhost page renders with tabs: Queue + History, using server-side templates

Assumptions:
- A simple Jinja2-rendered HTML page with placeholder content satisfies the "shell" requirement.

Implementation steps:
- Add Jinja2 template rendering for the root route and pass the request context.
- Create a minimal HTML template that renders two tabs (Queue, History) with placeholder panels.
- Keep the layout lightweight and offline-friendly (no external assets).
- Update the root test to assert an HTML response and presence of "Queue" and "History" text.
- Update docs tree if a new templates directory is added.
- Record test/lint results in `.agent/worker_report.md`.

Files likely to touch:
- `mlx_ui/app.py`
- `mlx_ui/templates/index.html`
- `tests/test_app.py`

thinking
**Checking presence of judge feedback**
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cat .agent/judge_feedback.md' in /Users/ivankhokhlov/code/mlx-ui succeeded in 93ms:

Notes:
- `make test` passes.
- `make lint` passes.
- Acceptance criteria met for WUI-001.

# Queue

## Now
- [ ] WUI-002 — Minimal WebUI shell (acceptance: localhost page renders with tabs: Queue + History, using server-side templates)

## Next
- [ ] WUI-010 — Upload endpoint + local storage (acceptance: user can upload multiple files; files saved under `data/uploads/` and jobs are created)
- [ ] WUI-011 — Persistent job store (SQLite) (acceptance: jobs survive server restart; history page lists prior jobs)
- [ ] WUI-012 — Sequential worker + fake transcriber (acceptance: single worker processes jobs strictly one-at-a-time; tests do not require ML model)

## Later
- [ ] WUI-020 — Integrate `wtm` CLI transcription (acceptance: for a job, system runs `wtm` with chosen language and produces at least `.txt` in `data/results/<job_id>/`)
- [ ] WUI-021 — Results browsing + download (acceptance: history page shows per-job links to view/download TXT and other generated formats)
- [ ] WUI-030 — One-command setup & run on M1+ macOS (acceptance: `./scripts/setup_and_run.sh` installs deps, downloads models, starts server, and opens browser)
- [ ] WUI-040 — Telegram delivery (acceptance: when env vars are set, send TXT + message; failures do not break pipeline; secrets masked)
- [ ] WUI-050 — Update check at startup (acceptance: if online, checks for updates with timeout; if offline, no errors and app works)
- [ ] WUI-090 — Live mode skeleton (acceptance: UI has “Live” page stub + technical plan in docs; no implementation yet)

## Done
- [x] WUI-001A — Fix pytest availability for `make test` (acceptance: `make test` succeeds in a clean env by ensuring pytest is installed or Makefile uses Poetry/venv)

**Planning minimal offline-friendly WebUI shell**

I'm preparing to create a simple HTML template with queue and history tabs including inline CSS and JS for offline use, ensuring accessibility and sticking to default ASCII and local fonts without relying on external assets while respecting developer instructions on frontend design scope.
thinking
**Designing styled minimal UI and updating docs**

I'm settling on using "Georgia" with fallback fonts for an expressive but offline-safe style, adding a gradient background and responsive tabs while keeping it minimal. I'll update tests to check for "Queue" and "History" in HTML responses and document the new template path in docs/tree.md and worker_report.md.

After runs, I’ll fix failures or update logs, overwrite the worker report with task details and results, append progress entries with timestamps, and handle .agent/BLOCKED carefully to avoid stale states while ensuring no outside repo changes. Next, I’ll check the existing worker_report.md format before implementing.

Task: WUI-001 — Bootstrap repo skeleton

What changed:
- Verified the minimal FastAPI app + test already satisfy the skeleton acceptance; no code changes required.
- Captured fresh test and lint logs for this iteration.

Files changed:
- .agent/worker_report.md
- .agent/progress.md
- .agent/logs/test_3.log
- .agent/logs/lint_3.log

Commands run + result:
- `make test` (pass)

**Planning app.py update with Jinja2 templates**

I'm preparing to update the root route in app.py to render an HTML template using Jinja2 with FastAPI, ensuring the response is an HTMLResponse and considering how to handle response type annotations to avoid linting issues. Next, I'll confirm the server binds only to 127.0.0.1 and add tests asserting HTML content in responses.

**Evaluating poetry.lock update necessity**

Determined that adding jinja2 as a new dependency requires updating poetry.lock to ensure consistent test environments, but this update should be done via regeneration commands rather than single-file patching.
thinking
**Assessing poetry.lock update under network constraints**

Deciding to check if jinja2 is already in poetry.lock before regenerating it, since updating the lock might require network access that is disallowed; this will inform whether a lock update is necessary for correctness without breaking constraints.

**Noticing missing jinja2 in lockfile**

The lockfile lacks jinja2, so it needs updating to avoid test failures when installing; although jinja2 might already be present in the environment, it's not guaranteed. I'll plan to update the lockfile despite potential network use to ensure consistent test installs.
thinking
**Deciding to update lockfile with poetry lock**

After adding jinja2 to pyproject, I'll run `poetry lock --no-update` to update the lockfile without broad changes, accepting possible network usage to ensure dependencies like jinja2 and markupsafe are included.

/bin/zsh -lc 'poetry lock --no-update' in /Users/ivankhokhlov/code/mlx-ui succeeded in 2.23s:

**Installing dependencies before tests**

The test failed due to jinja2 missing, so I'll run `poetry install` to ensure all dependencies from the lockfile are installed before rerunning tests.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'poetry install' in /Users/ivankhokhlov/code/mlx-ui succeeded in 1.50s:
Installing dependencies from lock file

Package operations: 2 installs, 0 updates, 0 removals

  • Installing markupsafe (3.0.3)
  • Installing jinja2 (3.1.6)

**Deciding on updating TemplateResponse call**

The new Starlette TemplateResponse expects the request as the first argument and the template name second, automatically handling the request in the context, so updating the call to `TemplateResponse(request, "index.html")` avoids warnings and aligns with the latest API.
thinking
**Verifying TemplateResponse signature**

I'm inspecting the installed Starlette templating code to confirm the exact TemplateResponse signature and understand how to pass additional context without triggering warnings.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc "python - <<'PY'
import inspect
from starlette.templating import Jinja2Templates
print(inspect.signature(Jinja2Templates.TemplateResponse))
PY" in /Users/ivankhokhlov/code/mlx-ui succeeded in 236ms:
(self, *args: 'typing.Any', **kwargs: 'typing.Any') -> '_TemplateResponse'

**Summarizing changes and commands for report**

I'm preparing a detailed worker report listing all changed files, key feature additions, and commands run including poetry lock, install, tests, and linting, noting the initial test failure due to missing dependency then successful rerun.

**Preparing updated worker report with timestamps**

I'm planning to include a note on the initial test failure due to missing Jinja2, append a timestamped summary to the progress log, and overwrite the worker report with the full updated content using a here-document.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc "cat <<'EOF' > .agent/worker_report.md
# Worker Report

Task: WUI-002 — Minimal WebUI shell

What changed:
- Rendered the root route with a Jinja2 template instead of JSON.
- Added a minimal offline-friendly HTML shell with Queue and History tabs.
- Updated tests to assert HTML content and documented the new templates directory.
- Added Jinja2 to dependencies and refreshed the lock file.

Files changed:
- mlx_ui/app.py
- mlx_ui/templates/index.html
- tests/test_app.py
- docs/tree.md
- pyproject.toml
- poetry.lock
- .agent/worker_report.md
- .agent/progress.md
- .agent/logs/test_4.log
- .agent/logs/lint_4.log

Commands run + result:
- "'`poetry lock --no-update` (pass)
- `poetry install` (pass)
- `make test` (pass)
- `make lint` (pass)

**Preparing final summary and next steps**

I'm consolidating implementation details, confirming tests passed, and including pointers to logs and worker reports. I'll highlight the jinja2 dependency update and suggest natural next steps like running the server with a numbered list.
thinking
**Crafting final concise report**

I'm finalizing a brief summary highlighting the Jinja2 template addition, offline-friendly UI shell, dependency updates, test pass status, and locations of logs and worker report, followed by a numeric next step to run the UI.
codex
Rendered the root route with a Jinja2 template and added a minimal offline-friendly Queue/History tab shell in `mlx_ui/templates/index.html`, updating `mlx_ui/app.py` and `tests/test_app.py` to serve and validate HTML; documented the templates directory in `docs/tree.md` and added `jinja2` to `pyproject.toml` with `poetry.lock` refreshed.

**Tests**
- `make test` (pass)
- `make lint` (pass)

**Logs**
- `.agent/worker_report.md`
- `.agent/logs/test_4.log`
- `.agent/logs/lint_4.log`

Next step:
1) `make run` to view the new UI shell in the browser.
