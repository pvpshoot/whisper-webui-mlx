Verdict: NEEDS_WORK  
Tests: `make test` failed locally — `/Users/ivankhokhlov/code/mlx-ui/.venv/bin/python: No module named pytest`  
Acceptance: not met because tests don’t pass  
Queue next: “Fix WUI-001 — ensure `make test` uses installed dev deps (pytest missing in venv)” in `/.agent/queue.md`  
Judge feedback: actionable checklist in `/.agent/judge_feedback.md`  
Progress log: appended JUDGE entry in `/.agent/progress.md`  
State updated: `/.agent/state.md` reflects NEEDS_WORK + failure count  
Logs: failure details in `/.agent/logs/test_1.log`  
Notes: no product code changes made during judging  
Next step: ensure dev deps are installed or Makefile uses Poetry/venv so `make test` passes
