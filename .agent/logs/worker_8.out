Integrated a `wtm`-backed transcriber so the worker now runs the CLI with a language/output directory and verifies TXT output, with subprocess mocked in tests to avoid the real model.
- `mlx_ui/transcriber.py`: added `WtmTranscriber` (env `WTM_PATH`, `WTM_LANGUAGE`) plus error handling and TXT discovery.
- `mlx_ui/worker.py`: default transcriber now uses `WtmTranscriber` when none is injected.
- `tests/test_transcriber.py`: new mocked-subprocess test that asserts the CLI command and resulting TXT path.
- `docs/tree.md`: documented the new test file.

Tests: `make test` (pass, log `.agent/logs/test_8.log`); `make lint` (pass, log `.agent/logs/lint_8.log`).
Worker report: `.agent/worker_report.md`.

Next steps (optional):
1) Run `make run` and upload a file to exercise `wtm` end-to-end on your machine.
2) Set `WTM_PATH` or `WTM_LANGUAGE` if your CLI lives outside PATH or you want a different default language.
