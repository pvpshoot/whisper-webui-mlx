Implemented multi-file uploads with in-memory job tracking so uploads are saved under `data/uploads/<job_id>/` and appear in the Queue UI.

- `mlx_ui/app.py` adds the uploads directory handling, job record model, and `/upload` endpoint; jobs are passed to the template for rendering.
- `mlx_ui/templates/index.html` now includes an upload form and a queued jobs list.
- `tests/test_app.py` covers multi-file uploads and validates file persistence and job registration with cleanup.
- `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` add `python-multipart` for FastAPI file uploads.
- `docs/tree.md` documents the `data/` runtime storage folder.

Tests: `make test` pass; `make lint` pass.  
Worker report: `.agent/worker_report.md`  
Logs: `.agent/logs/test_5.log`, `.agent/logs/lint_5.log`

Next step:
1) Run `make run` and try uploading a couple of files in the Queue tab to confirm the flow end-to-end.
