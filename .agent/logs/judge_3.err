# JUDGE AGENT (3-phase harness)

You are the JUDGE in a Planner→Worker→Judge pipeline.
Your job: evaluate the Worker’s changes against the acceptance criteria and quality bar.
Then decide: PASS / NEEDS_WORK / BLOCKED, update durable state, and steer the next cycle.

Non-interactive run (`codex exec`): do not ask questions.

## Stop conditions
- If `.agent/STOP` exists: append “STOP seen” to `.agent/progress.md` and exit.
- If `.agent/DONE` exists: append “DONE seen” to `.agent/progress.md` and exit.

## Inputs you MUST read
- `.agent/PROJECT.md` (authoritative)
- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/spec.md`
- `.agent/plan.md`
- `.agent/worker_report.md`
- `.agent/queue.md`
- `.agent/progress.md`
- `.agent/state.md`
- `.agent/BLOCKED.md` (if present)
- relevant `.agent/logs/*` for this iteration (if present)

## What you are allowed to change
- `.agent/**` (including queue, state, judge feedback)
- `docs/**` (only if needed for correctness)
Optionally: you MAY commit if AUTO_COMMIT=yes and the change passes.
Avoid editing product/source code; your role is evaluation and steering.

## Required checks (do these)
1) Inspect repo state:
   - `git status --porcelain` (if git exists)
   - `git diff` (skim for scope creep, hacks, missing tests, secrets)
2) Re-run TEST_CMD yourself (preferred). If it is clearly too slow, rely on worker logs but SAY SO.
3) Compare outcome to the acceptance criteria in `.agent/plan.md`.

## Verdict logic
- PASS:
  - Tests pass
  - Acceptance criteria met
  - No obvious regressions / unacceptable hacks
  - No secrets in logs or UI
- NEEDS_WORK:
  - Close but failing tests, missing acceptance criteria, incorrect behavior, poor UX, missing docs/tests
- BLOCKED:
  - Cannot proceed without human input, missing credentials, ambiguous spec, environment broken, etc.

## State updates (MUST do)
Update `.agent/state.md` with:
- last_task_id
- last_verdict (PASS/NEEDS_WORK/BLOCKED)
- consecutive_failures (increment if not PASS; reset to 0 on PASS)

Update `.agent/queue.md`:
- On PASS: move the task to Done (checked)
- On NEEDS_WORK: keep task unchecked; optionally add a “Fix …” subtask at top of Now
- On BLOCKED:
  - keep task unchecked
  - ensure `.agent/BLOCKED.md` exists
  - create `.agent/STOP` so the outer loop halts

Write `.agent/judge_feedback.md`:
- On PASS: write “PASS” + brief notes (or minimal “no issues”)
- On NEEDS_WORK: write a very actionable checklist for the next Worker attempt
- On BLOCKED: write exactly what is needed from a human

Append a JUDGE entry to `.agent/progress.md`:
- timestamp
- CODEX_ITERATION
- verdict + why
- test results (your rerun or what you relied on)

If queue has no unchecked tasks left: create `.agent/DONE`.

## Optional auto-commit
If AUTO_COMMIT=yes and verdict=PASS and git repo exists:
- make a single commit: "<task id>: <title>"
If git is not configured or commit fails, just log it and move on.

## Output
Print a short summary (10–20 lines):
- verdict
- tests status
- queue next task
- where to look (judge_feedback, progress)

**Deciding file reading method**

I'm choosing to read inputs by concatenating required files directly rather than using ripgrep, simplifying the approach with sed or cat.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cat .agent/PROJECT.md' in /Users/ivankhokhlov/code/mlx-ui succeeded in 99ms:
# PROJECT (single source of truth for the harness)

PROJECT_NAME: "whisper-webui-mlx"
REPO_KIND: "new repo"

## Brief (1–2 paragraphs)
Build a **local macOS app for Apple Silicon (M1+)** that exposes a **Web UI on localhost** to manage **offline transcription** of audio/video files using the engine from `whisper-turbo-mlx` via its CLI `wtm` (MLX). https://github.com/JosefAlbers/whisper-turbo-mlx

Turn the current console workflow (e.g. `wtm ... --any_lang=True`) into a tool that is easy to deploy on another M1+ Mac with **one command**, supports **batch uploads**, a **strictly sequential** processing queue (no parallelism), **job history + downloads**, optional **Telegram delivery of TXT results**, and (in the final phase) **live recording + chunked transcription**.

## Primary stack
Python 3.11+
- Backend/Web: FastAPI + Uvicorn
- Templates/UI: Jinja2 + minimal vanilla JS (no external CDNs; must work offline)
- Storage: SQLite (jobs metadata) + local filesystem (uploads/results/logs)
- Worker: a single sequential worker consuming a persistent queue
- Transcription: subprocess call to `wtm` with explicit language selection

## Commands (choose defaults if unknown)
TEST_CMD: "make test"

thinking
**Clarifying agent read logic**

The agents are already supplied, but the file is still being read. I need to verify if reading the file here is redundant or necessary.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cat AGENTS.md' in /Users/ivankhokhlov/code/mlx-ui succeeded in 97ms:
# AGENTS.md

This repo is developed using an autonomous loop (Planner → Worker → Judge) driven by `codex exec`.
Because each run starts with limited context, **durable state MUST be stored in `.agent/`**.

## Source of truth
- `.agent/PROJECT.md` — high-level constraints and commands
- `docs/spec.md` — product requirements
- `.agent/queue.md` — backlog (Judge marks tasks done)

## How to run
- Tests: `make test`
- Lint: `make lint`
- Format: `make fmt`
- Run server: `make run`

If Makefile does not exist yet, create it during bootstrap.

## Safety / security rules
- Never touch anything outside the repo root.

thinking
**Noting documentation need**
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cat docs/spec.md' in /Users/ivankhokhlov/code/mlx-ui succeeded in 87ms:
# Spec — whisper-webui-mlx

## Goal
Create a **local-only** tool for **macOS Apple Silicon (M1+)** that provides a **Web UI on localhost** to manage **local transcription** of audio/video files using the engine from `whisper-turbo-mlx` via its CLI `wtm` (MLX).

The tool must be easy to deploy to another M1+ Mac (one command), and after the initial setup + model download it must work **fully offline**.

## MVP: Batch file transcription via Web UI
### UX
- User opens Web UI (localhost).
- User uploads **one or multiple files** (audio or video).
- User selects the **language manually** (no auto-detect).
- Files are placed into a **queue** and processed **strictly sequentially** (no parallel jobs).
- UI has:
  - Queue view: current job + pending jobs
  - History view: completed jobs + access to results

### Processing rules
- One worker processes one job at a time (sequential).
- Keep the ML model “warm” behavior in mind: avoid parallelism and avoid reinitialization churn.

thinking
**Planning to review agent logs**

I'm preparing to read the agent plan and worker report files to gather details needed for the next steps.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cat .agent/plan.md' in /Users/ivankhokhlov/code/mlx-ui succeeded in 95ms:
# Plan

Task: WUI-001 — Bootstrap repo skeleton
Acceptance: `make test` passes with a minimal FastAPI app + 1–3 tests, and docs/agent harness files exist

Implementation steps:
- Inspect the existing FastAPI app and test(s) to confirm the minimal skeleton is in place.
- Ensure required harness/docs files exist and are minimally populated (do not add new product code beyond the skeleton).
- If anything is missing for the acceptance criteria, add or adjust the minimal app/test or docs to satisfy it.
- Keep changes small and focused; avoid adding new features beyond the skeleton.
- Run the verification commands and record results in `.agent/worker_report.md`.

Files likely to touch:
- `mlx_ui/app.py`
- `tests/test_app.py`
- `Makefile`
- `docs/dev.md`
- `.agent/worker_report.md`

Verification:

thinking
**Listing required entities**

I've identified that the implementation needs worker_report, queue, progress, state, and BLOCKED to proceed.
exec

# Worker Report

Task: WUI-001 — Bootstrap repo skeleton

What changed:
- Verified the minimal FastAPI app + test already satisfy the skeleton acceptance; no code changes required.
- Captured fresh test and lint logs for this iteration.

Files changed:
- .agent/worker_report.md
- .agent/progress.md
- .agent/logs/test_3.log
- .agent/logs/lint_3.log

Commands run + result:
- `make test` (pass)
- `make lint` (pass)

/bin/zsh -lc 'cat .agent/queue.md' in /Users/ivankhokhlov/code/mlx-ui succeeded in 96ms:
# Queue

## Now
- [ ] WUI-001 — Bootstrap repo skeleton (acceptance: `make test` passes with a minimal FastAPI app + 1–3 tests, and docs/agent harness files exist)
- [ ] WUI-002 — Minimal WebUI shell (acceptance: localhost page renders with tabs: Queue + History, using server-side templates)

## Next
- [ ] WUI-010 — Upload endpoint + local storage (acceptance: user can upload multiple files; files saved under `data/uploads/` and jobs are created)
- [ ] WUI-011 — Persistent job store (SQLite) (acceptance: jobs survive server restart; history page lists prior jobs)
- [ ] WUI-012 — Sequential worker + fake transcriber (acceptance: single worker processes jobs strictly one-at-a-time; tests do not require ML model)

## Later
- [ ] WUI-020 — Integrate `wtm` CLI transcription (acceptance: for a job, system runs `wtm` with chosen language and produces at least `.txt` in `data/results/<job_id>/`)
- [ ] WUI-021 — Results browsing + download (acceptance: history page shows per-job links to view/download TXT and other generated formats)
- [ ] WUI-030 — One-command setup & run on M1+ macOS (acceptance: `./scripts/setup_and_run.sh` installs deps, downloads models, starts server, and opens browser)
- [ ] WUI-040 — Telegram delivery (acceptance: when env vars are set, send TXT + message; failures do not break pipeline; secrets masked)
- [ ] WUI-050 — Update check at startup (acceptance: if online, checks for updates with timeout; if offline, no errors and app works)
- [ ] WUI-090 — Live mode skeleton (acceptance: UI has “Live” page stub + technical plan in docs; no implementation yet)

**Reviewing code changes for scope and secrets**

I'll inspect the git diff for all modified files, focusing on .agent files primarily but also reviewing README, docs, pyproject, Makefile, and key source files to confirm no scope creep, hacks, or secrets were introduced beyond the intended updates.
thinking
**Preparing judge state updates after passing first task**

I’m planning to update .agent files to mark the first task as passed, clear the queue entry, and append progress with the current iteration (likely 3). I’ll also consider removing or updating .agent/BLOCKED.md since blocking is resolved, though instructions don’t require removal.

thinking
**Planning state file updates**

I'm updating the agent's last_judge file with the current info and verifying if last_worker or last_planner need changes; last_worker likely doesn't, and last_planner isn't needed. I'll also check judge_feedback contents before updating.
exec

Notes:
- `make test` passes via Poetry.
- Acceptance criteria met; no issues found.


thinking
**Cleaning agent state files**

I'm updating .agent/queue.md to mark the patch task done, removing the stale .agent/BLOCKED.md to avoid confusion, and revising .agent/state.md, progress, judge_feedback, and last_judge accordingly to reflect the current unblocked, ongoing status.
thinking
**Verifying acceptance and planning patch update**

I confirmed the FastAPI app and tests meet acceptance and plan to document that in judge feedback and progress. Next, I'll apply a patch updating .agent/queue.md to move WUI-001 from Now to Done, placing it after WUI-001A.

**Summarizing final task results**

The verdict is PASS with all tests (make test and make lint) passing. The acceptance check confirms a minimal FastAPI skeleton. The next queue task is WUI-002. Updated files include state, queue, judge_feedback, progress, and .agent/BLOCKED, which was rewritten with a resolved note. The summary points to judge_feedback and progress for details, highlighting that .agent/BLOCKED remains with a resolved note per update.

**Crafting detailed final summary**

I'm creating a 10-line bullet list summary with verdict, tests rerun status, acceptance confirmation, queue updates, state and feedback files updated, progress log, and a note that `.agent/BLOCKED.md` is marked resolved, referencing all file paths precisely.

- Verdict: PASS
- Tests: `make test` (pass, rerun)
- Tests: `make lint` (pass, rerun)
